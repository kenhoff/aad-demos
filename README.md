### Things your demo should include

#### General Rules
- screenshots encouraged
- this is *public-facing* documentation - no business-impacting material
- check out existing demo scripts for guidance
- there's *always* exceptions to the rule - open an issue if you have any questions - for business-impacting stuff email kenhoff@microsoft.com

Two sections:

#### Setup
- no completion time limit - some demos are complex, so setup can take as long as it needs to
- make it as end-to-end as possible, but omit trivial material and link to other demos as necessary

#### Walkthrough
- completable in 2-5 minutes
- *show*, but don't *do* config - "like a cooking show"
- include speaker instructions *and* speaker talking points
